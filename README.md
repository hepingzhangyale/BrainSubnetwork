# cluster_on_unobservable_information

This repository provides R implementation of a new method that performs clustering or constructs networks based on unobservable information. 
It contains all the codes produced and used in the paper "Identifying Group-wise Mixtures in High-Dimensional Multi-Task Learning Model with an Application in Constructing Brain Subnetworks"

There are two directories named "Simulations" and "Application", which contain the R codes for simulations and application, respectively.

## Codes for simulations

We test the proposed method in six different settings. In each setting, a seperate .R file is provided with the name "simulation_setting#.R". The codes for evaluation and plots are in two other .R files with the names "evaluating_simulation.R" and "simulation_plot.R".  

## Codes for application

The datasets are downloaded from this public database "Human Connectome Project" (https://www.humanconnectome.org/).
The codes are selfexplanable by the file names.  

# Welcome to use and modify our codes

We encourage you to use and adopt codes in this repository. Please cite our paper "Identifying Group-wise Mixtures in High-Dimensional Multi-Task Learning Model with an Application in Constructing Brain Subnetworks" upon using the code. 
Details of the method can also be found in the paper.
